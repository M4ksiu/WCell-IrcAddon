Welcome to the new irc addon repo.

This addon acts as a remote control service through IRC.

Calling server commands via IRC
Handling tickets via IRC (note: currently you can only handle the tickets, GM <-> User chat not supported yet)
Complex and secure authing
Matching irc nicks to ingame accounts and saving the associations in a file
Getting the role of an account and giving it to the irc user
The most up-to-date status of the server and setting it to topic without interfering with anything
Easily configurable using an XML config file (no need to go into code to enable/disable important features)
